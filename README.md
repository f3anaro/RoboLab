RoboLab 2012
============

Source code of the NXT competition [RoboLab](http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/fakultaeten/fakultaet_informatik/sysa/se/teaching/courses/ws/einfuehrungspraktikum_roboter_lab)
at the TU Dresden during the winter semester 2012.

The goal was to create a NXT robot that searches fpr tokens in a unknown maze.
The program is written in C. At this time I hasn't the glue about Makefiles etc.,
so please - be indulgent about the quality of the source code.
